        ruleDescr: "This is really the only point to be made here. YOU DON'T NEED TOOLS. You don't need any of these guidelines. They're already dated in face of the thing you wanna say. YOU JUST NEED A MESSAGE, YOU JUST NEED TO TALK."
    },
    {

        ruleName: "Finish Authentic, Raw, & ASAP",
        ruleDescr: "Fuck production value. Fixed lens. Use a single synth texture. Get form out of the way. Simplify the setup and let the content speak. Anyone with access to your tools could have done this. What gives is your heart. Music recorded in a single track with voice and instrument without BPM then worked around the momentum."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Conclude as an Offering Pitch",
        ruleDescr: "Finish to the point of offering to God. Trust that God is your most avant-garde creative partner and executive producer and can see the soul past the production value. You are trying to put together a pitch to God. It's like you're showing him a menu for your restaurant."

        ruleDescr: "Aim at being accused of being unoriginal, and of replicating ideas that have been done 'way too much' already. You need them."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Get Lame",
        ruleDescr: "Say awkward truths you feel like saying, especially if you're 'reinventing the wheel', or 'about to ruin your career', or 'finally getting caught as an impostor'. Sample Coldplay. It's a terrible idea and it won’t work."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Get Hated",

    },
    {
        ruleName: "Get Dunning–Kruger-ing",
        ruleDescr: "Fuck being a virtuoso. Use tools you don't know how to use. Intuition and instincts bring greater ideas than rationality. Do not allow 'experts' to edit you through invasive thoughts."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Unlearn Templates",
        ruleDescr: "Become a native person getting in touch with a drum kit for the first time ever. How would that look like? Maybe you wouldn't sit. Maybe you would throw pieces of the drum kit around, and that would express your joy of having found a wild horse."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Get the Word Out",
        ruleDescr: "Ship a short 30-sec preview that captures the momentum. Fuck feeds. Only emails or DMs of a single preview file. Send the file, not a link. Website features a newsletter for notifications about new stuff."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Ship Daily",
        ruleDescr: "It's a diary entry, so there's no right or wrong. A daily podcast showcases artist + excerpt of piece in under 10mins."
    },
    {
        ruleName: "Faith in the Randomness of Love/Hate",
        ruleDescr: "People love/hate everything based on random factors outside of your control. That's good news because it means there's always going to be some people who are into / cringe at your stuff, anywhere from an Ed Sheeran cover to your Marina Abramovićing."
